**Task 4**: Advanced AES-256 Encryption Tool
To fulfill the encryption task, I created a Python tool that robustly encrypts and decrypts files using the AES-256 algorithm in CBC mode with proper padding and a random initialization vector (IV). I used the pycryptodome library and corrected import statements to Crypto namespace ensuring compatibility.

Password-based key derivation using SHA-256 hashes the user’s password into a secure 256-bit key. Encrypted files store the IV concatenated with ciphertext for straightforward decryption. The tool features a clear, console-based user interface guiding users through encrypting or decrypting files securely.

This project challenged me to implement strong cryptographic practices and develop a tool that balances security and usability—a key skill in data protection and cybersecurity applications.
